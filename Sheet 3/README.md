# Exercise Sheet 3: Principal Component Analysis

Check the steps from the readme of exercise 1 to get started with working with Anaconda / virtual environments.

The accompanying material includes a [Jupyter notebook](PCA.ipynb) which 
should be used as a template for your solution. The material also 
includes the datasets and some Python code you may use. 

We decided to provide the solutions for the first part of the bonus task 3.7 which applies PCA to the HOG features of the data instead of applying PCA to the data directly. Here "int_train_features" should be your training data points.
If you want to, you can ignore our implementation and try to implement the HoG features yourself.
